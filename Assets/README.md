This is where the assets should be stored, Pizza Tower Assets, etc.

The assets folder have to be stored like this
```
Assets/music
Assets/sfx
```

To get the Assets, you can get one [this here from a seperate github repository!]() (TODO: made one)
This is for in order to avoid bunch of shit in the commits
NOTE: The Assets here probably still missing some of the assets, and the intents are for to have the complete raw assets instead of ripping the assets

Or if you want to get one yourself, you can extract it using the [Unofficial FMOD Banks Tool](https://gamebanana.com/tools/12100)
**BUT** you might have to rename all of the file extension names to ogg first!
(TODO: make an automated pythgon script to do this)

Put it into the repository Assets folder, and you should be good to go to open this with FMOD Studio!

For your mod, you can name the folder names like this! (or you can do it freely as you one tbh)
```
Assets/your-modname/music
Assets/your-modname/sfx
```

Just incase if you want to sync the Assets while keeping your modded assets from your mod asset folder
You can make use of directory links on the commant prompt/terminal (mklink, etc)
